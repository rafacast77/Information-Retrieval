# Information-Retrieval   :desktop_computer: 
This repository contains the reports and module description from the Information Retrieval course I have undergone at RGU. We studied the main concepts and technologies for information search and retrieval applications.

## Technologies and techniques used for this project

### Recommender System
   
* Built a web crawler to retrieve web pages using **RapidMiner**. Engineer a content-based text recommender system and created an item recommender system to predict ratings. The RapidMiner files and report can be found on the "Recommender Systems" folder within this repository.
   * RapidMiner
   * Item base recommender system
   * User base recommender system
   * Web crawling
   * Text-pre-processing
   * Evaluation techniques (MAE)
   * K-nearest neighbours
   
### Retrieval Evaluation
* Experimented and researched a search engine built in **Java** on the **Netbeans** interface, compared it's inverted index with and without stemming as well as precision and recall calculations with specified weighting functions and discussed results. The report can be found on the "Retrieval Evaluation" folder within this repository.
   * Netbeans
   * Java
   * Inverted Index
   * Document Matrix
   * Weighting Schemes
